The question goes:

    We are improving a drawing application.
    The application needs to support adding and comparing two Shape objects.
    Add the corresponding methods to enable addition + and comparison using the greater than > operator for the Shape class.
    The addition should return a new object with the sum of the widths and heights of the operands, while the comparison should 
    return the result of comparing the areas of the objects.
    N/B The given code creates two Shape objects from user input, outputs the area() of their addition and compares them.\i\
