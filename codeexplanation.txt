Sure, let's go through the provided code step by step.

### 1. `Shape` Class Definition

```python
class Shape: 
    def __init__(self, w, h):
        self.width = w
        self.height = h

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    def __add__(self, other):
        new_width = self.width + other.width
        new_height = self.height + other.height
        return Shape(new_width, new_height)

    def __gt__(self, other):
        return self.area() > other.area()
```

#### Explanation:

- **`__init__(self, w, h)`**: This is the constructor method for the `Shape` class. It initializes a shape object with width `w` and height `h`.

- **`area(self)`**: This method calculates the area of the shape using the formula `width * height`.

- **`__add__(self, other)`**: This special method (`__add__`) is overridden to define the behavior of the addition operator (`+`) for instances of the `Shape` class. When you use `s1 + s2`, it creates a new `Shape` object whose width is the sum of `s1`'s and `s2`'s widths, and height is the sum of `s1`'s and `s2`'s heights.

- **`__gt__(self, other)`**: This special method (`__gt__`) is overridden to define the behavior of the greater than operator (`>`). It compares the areas of two shapes (`self` and `other`) and returns `True` if the area of `self` is greater than the area of `other`, otherwise `False`.

### 2. Input and Output

```python
w1 = int(input())
h1 = int(input())
w2 = int(input())
h2 = int(input())

s1 = Shape(w1, h1)
s2 = Shape(w2, h2)
result = s1 + s2

print(result.area())
print(s1 > s2)
```

#### Explanation:

- **Input**: It reads four integers from standard input (`w1`, `h1`, `w2`, `h2`), which represent the width and height of two shapes.

- **Shape Initialization**: It creates two `Shape` objects `s1` and `s2` using the input width and height values.

- **Addition (`+`)**: It performs the addition operation (`s1 + s2`), which invokes the `__add__` method of the `Shape` class. This results in a new `Shape` object `result` whose width and height are the sums of `s1` and `s2`.

- **Output**:
  - `print(result.area())`: Outputs the area of the `result` shape (the sum of `s1` and `s2`).
  - `print(s1 > s2)`: Outputs the result of comparing `s1` and `s2` based on their areas. This uses the `__gt__` method defined earlier.

### Summary

The code defines a `Shape` class with methods to calculate the area, perform addition of shapes, and compare shapes based on their areas. It reads input to create two `Shape` objects, performs addition to create a new shape, and then outputs the area of the resulting shape and the result of the comparison between the two original shapes based on their areas.
